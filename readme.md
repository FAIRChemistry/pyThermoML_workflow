# pythermo_workflow

**Authors:** Matthias Gueltig

This repository provides the python code of the workflow described in the paper: Integration of simulated and experimentally determined thermophysical properties of aqueous mixtures by ThermoML.

Details concerning simulations can be found in `workflow_simulation`. A jupyter-notebook performing data integration, analysis and visualization with its corresponding modules is available in `workflow_analysis`. Code that transforms previous CML to ThermoML documents can be found in `cml_to_thermoml`.

To execute code of this repository please make sure having installed the following libraries:
* matplotlib
* numpy
* pandas
* pydantic
* sklearn
