# workflow_analysis

This directory contains:
* mixturemm_files: Simulated measurements of density and self-diffusion coefficient for aqueous methanol and glycerol mixtures as .json files from `MixtureMM`-workflow.
* txt_files: Manually extracted experimental measurements of density and diffusion coefficents for aqueous methanol and glycerol mixtures as .txt files.
* thermoml_files: Created ThermoML files of simulated and experimental data. Created with `experimental_thermoml`, `mixturemm_thermoml` and functionalites of `pyThermoML`.
* plots: Visualizations of integrated chemical quantities.

The workflow itself is performed in `workflow.ipynb`.
